# C++ Problem Solving Repository

Welcome! This repository contains my journey of solving C++ problems to improve my programming skills and prepare for future opportunities.

## About Me
- Ghulam Baqir
- Consistently solving C++ problems and pushing solutions to GitHub.

## How to Use
Each `.cpp` file contains a solution to a specific problem.  
To compile and run a file (example for `test.cpp`):

```sh
g++ test.cpp -o test
./test
```

## Progress

| Problem File   | Description                | Branch      | Commit Message           |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| test.cpp       | Sample commit test         | test        | Second commit           |

## Goals
- Solve multiple C++ problems weekly.
- Track progress and maintain clean code.
- Prepare for technical interviews.
